# ðŸ§¬ SimEVO â€” Evolutionary Simulation v1.0.0
This project aims to simulate the adaptation of natural populations as a result of selection. For more information on how the algorithm is constructed and operates, read the ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` file included in the repository. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the Jupyter Notebook that can be found in the ```notes``` directory.

## Installation
The module can be installed using pip:
```pip install EvoAlg```

## Features
- Configurable environmental difficulty with increment/decrement option
- Specification of mutation ratio and check population size
- Visualize algorithm output using Matplotlib
- Write out data as CSV files for data analysis

## Future implementations
