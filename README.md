# Evolution project
## Current development status
- Have added basic "playing field" and movement for organisms
- Food now spawns at the beginning of each generation
- Neural network for organism behaviour has been implemented

## Todos
- Reproduction
- Refactor NN to use Tensorflow libraries for variable input shapes
- Rework dimensional configuration of environment (float instead of grid)
- Rework organism input mapping functionality and movement (see notes)
