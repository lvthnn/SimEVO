# ðŸ§¬ EVOALG Evolutionary Algorithm v1.0.0
This project aims to simulate the adaptation of natural populations as a result of selection. For more information on how the algorithm is constructed and operates, read the INFORMATION.md file included in the repository. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the Jupyter Notebook that can be found in the "notes" directory.

## Installation
The module can be installed using pip:
```pip install EvoAlg```

## Features
- Configurable environmental difficulty with increment/decrement option
- Specification of mutation ratio and check population size
- Visualize algorithm output using Matplotlib
- Write out data as CSV files for data analysis

## Future implementations
