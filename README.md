# ðŸ§¬ SimEVO â€” Evolutionary Simulation v1.0.0
This project aims to simulate the adaptation of natural populations as a result of selection. For more information on how the algorithm is constructed and operates, read the ```DOCUMENTATION.md``` file included in the repository. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the Jupyter Notebook that can be found in the ```notes``` directory.

## Installation
The module can be installed using pip:
```pip install simevo```

**Notice:** As of currently, the package is not functional for use. I am redesigning some elements of the model and hence it will take some time before the algorithm can be used again.

## Features
- Individual based simulation
- Configurable environmental difficulty with increment/decrement option
- Specification of mutation ratio and check population size
- Visualize algorithm output using Matplotlib
- Write out data as CSV files for data analysis

## Future implementations
- [ ] Implement independent module structure
- [ ] Add optional visualization and data out function
- [ ] Optimization
